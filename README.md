# Music Analysis
 
Got bored and wanted to analyze the music I listen to

This was done in Python, and I'm hoping to make frequent updates to this project

# Recent Work

1. Exported Apple Music Library Data into a txt file
2. Created a list of Song class instances
3. Manually Sort the data (by year and decade of release)
4. Plot the data

Please use this to prove to your friends that listening to Tyler the Creator is not Original ðŸ¥¸
